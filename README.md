# ✏️ [Anand Chowdhary's README](https://anandchowdhary.github.io/readme/)

> **Note**
> This is a guide on how to work with me, inspired by the READMEs of [Quinn Slack](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/team/ceo/) and fellow YC founders [Tim Glaser](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/tim-glaser) and [Sid Sijbrandij](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/).

## Bio

I made my first website and [published](https://web.archive.org/web/20081019093430/http://www.namah.org:80/anand/) it to the web when I was ten years old. Since then, I've moved on from focusing on Photoshop and Dreamweaver to the JavaScript ecosystem and web standards. I'm from New Delhi and currently live and work remotely from Groningen, after previously living in Enschede and briefly the San Francisco Bay Area. I'm also an advisor to early-stage startups and open source contributor.
