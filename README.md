# ✏️ [Anand Chowdhary's README](https://anandchowdhary.github.io/readme/)

> **Note**
> This is a guide on how to work with me, inspired by the READMEs of [Quinn Slack](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/team/ceo/) and fellow YC founders [Tim Glaser](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/tim-glaser) and [Sid Sijbrandij](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/).

## Pronounciation

`/ɑnʌnð t͡ʃŏɖʱɹi/` (similar to _Aah-nun'd Cho-dree_).

## Bio

I made my first website and [published](https://web.archive.org/web/20081019093430/http://www.namah.org:80/anand/) it to the web when I was ten years old. Since then, I've moved on from focusing on Photoshop and Dreamweaver to the JavaScript ecosystem and web standards. I'm from New Delhi and currently live and work remotely from Groningen, after previously living in Enschede and briefly the San Francisco Bay Area. I'm also an advisor to early-stage startups and open source contributor.

## Quirks

- When in long meetings, I tend to get distracted and often find myself <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>↹</kbd> to a different window (I used to previously catch myself using my phone, so I keep it away from me now). I'm working on this but please call me out if you notice I'm not paying attention.
- I typically work long hours, so you might receive an email or Slack message from me at unholy hours; you don't have to read or reply immediately if you're not working, and I don't expect you to work at the same times.
- I'm still learning how to transition from a designer/developer/hacker/etc. to a manager, so you'll likely have to bare with my lack of discipline when it comes to important managerial responsibilities like setting up projects well in advance and providing useful feedback.
